We're skipping all tests as most require real machine and other fail
using t.fatal() which abort the while go test instead of using t.Fail()

Need to be fixed:
    1. Change all t.Fatal to t.Fail() so that go test suite will continue to rest of tests
    2. Emanage test suite should have two types of unitests:
            1. unitests vs mock-able management (mock rest-api).
            2. real tests vs real machine
